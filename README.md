## Files

	ADSR-ISF_1.349.amxd
	ADSR-sound_v0.12.amx3
	ADSR-world-out_0.1.amxd
	/ISF-files/getDown01.fs

## Blockers

1. Need to click BANG for each ADSR-sound_v0.12 track to set the base note (48)
2. Too many buttons to click when opening a project
	a. qmetro,mode,clear,transport stop, clear all clips, uggh too many!
3. Parameters like scale, stroke, distance, etc. are not stored in the project. Need to set these each time.
4. When you save there is too many buttons to click to get to a default state.

## Enhancements

	[ ] marquee select, delete
	[ ] orient per track
	[ ] solo visual track
	[x] store params per track. remember them in pattrstorage.

## Things that took the longest time:

- Selecting states.
- determining which track is which.


## What to work on next

- changing colors,sizes using params
- store params with Ableton project
